Hi, I'm Gwanghan Lee, from South Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·.
I received B.S/M.S in Organic and Nano System Engineering at [Konkuk University](http://www.konkuk.ac.kr/do/Eng/Index.do), and M.S in Artificial Intelligence at [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/).
Previously I worked at [DASH Lab](https://dash-lab.github.io/) advised by Prof. Simon S. Woo, and SK Telecom working with SKT SUPERNOVA team in 2022. 

My research interest broadly lies on Model Compression, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat or collaborate with me.
