Hi, Glad you stopped by :) I'm Saebyeol, ìƒˆë³„ from South Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·.
I am undergraduate student majoring in Data Science and Computer Science & Engineering at [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/).
Previously I interned at [DASH Lab](https://dash-lab.github.io/) advised by Prof. Simon S. Woo, and at SK Telecom working with SKT SUPERNOVA team in 2022.

My research broadly lies in developing efficient networks. Specifically, I would like to advance the performance as well as the efficiency of deep learning models in various tasks such as Computer Vision and NLP. Please reach out if you'd like to chat or collaborate with me.
