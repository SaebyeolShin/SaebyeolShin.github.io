Hi, I'm Saebyeol, incoming Computer Science Ph.D. student at Cornell University, advised by [Prof. Kilian Q. Weinberger](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kilian/). 

Previously I interned at Visual Informatics Group ([VITA](https://vita-group.github.io/index.html)) @ University of Texas at Austin, advised by [Prof. Zhangyang "Atlas" Wang](https://express.adobe.com/page/CAdrFMJ9QeI2y/). 
I recieved B.S. in Data Science & B.S in Computer Science and Engineering at [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/).

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat or collaborate with me.
