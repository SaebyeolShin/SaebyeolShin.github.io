Hi, Glad you stopped by :) I'm Saebyeol, ìƒˆë³„ from South Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·.
I am undergraduate student majoring in Data Science and Computer Science & Engineering at [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/).
Previously I interned at [DASH Lab](https://dash-lab.github.io/) advised by Prof. Simon S. Woo, and at SKT working with SKT SUPERNOVA team in 2022.

My research broadly lies in the areas of computer vision tasks but also interested in NLP and HCI. I hope to advance the efficiency of deep learning models as well as the performance. Please reach out if you'd like to chat or collaborate with me.
